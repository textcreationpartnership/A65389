            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>, <hi>Men were ſcorched with great heat, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the Name of God, and repented not to give him glory.</hi> Now, though truely we muſt profeſſe, with Reverend Mr. <hi>Eaton,</hi> Writing concerning the ſame people, in his Epiſtle to his Booke called, <hi>The Quakers confuted, That we cannot apprehend that there is any hope of convincing theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the error of their way, ſo farre are they under the very power of the ſpirit of deluſion, and profeſſed enmity to the Ordinances of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord:</hi> Yet, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecuring, and fuller ſatisfying of the people of God, we are induced to Anſwer this Reply of <hi>Iames Nayler,</hi> for the clearer manifeſting of the wickedneſſe and folly of theſe men, and their Principles: And though it coſt us new revilings, and more bitter curſings from this People which we fully expect: Yet what are we, and our Names, though troddon under foot ſo Ieſus Chriſt may have the glory, and his people the advantage of our ſtanding for the truth.</p>
            <p>But that thou mayeſt know the nature of their Anſwer, thus it is; We charge them to hold ſeventeen Blaſphemous and Hereticall Doctrines, beſides their other principles and practiſes, in our Booke expreſſed, and what he ſayes to them; we have given thee a ſhort account in the Draught ſubjoyned to our Epiſtle, Wherein thou wilt eaſily ſee with what full proofe we have teſtified thoſe things concerning them, though the tongues of theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Reader, If thou haſt Read our former Booke, thou wilt finde our Arguments and aſſertions againſt the blaſphemous Doctrines of theſe men, fully ſtrengthened by plentifull variety of evident, plaine, convincing Scriptures; to which thou wilt finde <hi>Iames Nayler</hi> in his Reply, anſwering not one word. Certainly, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the ſpirit of God, either hath convincingly ſilenced him, and ſtopp'd his mouth (for how ready is he to catch at any trifling appearance of advantage?) or what canſt thou, or any man imagine of him, but that Scripture is nothing to him, nor his ſoule under any obedience unto, or conſcience of the truth of God? either of which, What a miſerable and deplorable ſtate of ſoule, doth it ſpeake, when men can ſtand out in their blaſpemies againſt the light of Conſcience?</p>
            <p>It ſhall be our worke in this enſuing <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> in following <hi>Iames Nayler</hi> in his Reply, to anſwer all ſuch Scriptures as he impertinently and injuriouſly wreſts, and to cleare the truths of God from their being miſapplyed to his horrid Principles. By which, and other occaſionall paſſages in this Booke, thou wilt find a more full and plaine manifeſtation of theſe men, and diſcovery of the myſtery of iniquity working in them. Conſider what thou Readeſt, and the Lord give thee underſtanding in all things.</p>

               <p>Further, he goes on, and tells the Reader, <hi>We are not afraid to ſpeake evill of their forſaking the world, the pride and luſts of it;</hi> and theſe (he ſaies) we call, <hi>a ſinfull neglect of their Families, triviall obſervations,</hi> and bely <hi>the Apoſtle,</hi> ſaying, <hi>he calls them rudiments of the World.</hi> Reader, that thou mayſt ſee the wilfull (and we are afraid) malitious miſtake of the man; we ſhall give thee our owne words as they are in our Epiſtle, thus, <hi>There is indeed ſomething which pretends to holineſſe in this generation of men: as the meanneſſe of their apparell, ſometimes more then ordinary abſtinence, their forſaking the World (though to a ſinfull neglect of their Families and Callings) and many triviall obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which the Apoſtle calls, <hi>The rudiments of the world.</hi> Col. 2.23.

               <p n="2">2.

It conſiſts in a willingneſſe of ſpirit to part with theſe things when thereunto called; which is in caſe of competition betwixt Chriſt and our enjoyments; in reference whereto, the Saints have need to ſit downe before-hand and reckon this, the charge of the Goſpel may coſt them one day their deareſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as it coſts us the ſcandals and reproaches of our Perſons as this day from theſe Quakers.

                  <p n="2">2. Here thou haſt our innocency vindicated; and now what reaſon hath <hi>Nayler</hi> to call us <hi>the ſervants of the Devill,</hi> and <hi>venters of lyes?</hi> when as thou ſeeſt his deniall of that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, is but the backing of his owne blaſphemy with a <hi>notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lye,</hi> which muſt needs fly in in his face, if he have any ſparke of conſcience left in him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This full teſtimony gives a further diſcovery of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions we formerly layd downe; as firſt, Their aſſerting <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> in this life, <hi>and to be without ſinne,</hi> As alſo ſecondly, Not onely <hi>Nayler,</hi> but <hi>Farnſworth</hi> alſo affirmed, he was as holy, juſt, and good as God for ſo ſaith <hi>Will.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we can bleſſe the Lord that our being forced by <hi>Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> his charging us with lyes, to vindicate the truth hath been an occaſion to diſcover the blaſphemies of theſe men more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly and convincingly unto all.</p>

                  <p>But we wonder how they dare deny theſe things? or why <hi>Nayler</hi> ſhould ſtand diſputing againſt theſe teſtimonies? when their being equall with God is fully layd downe in <hi>Foxes</hi> owne words in Print; See <hi>Sauls Errand to Damaſcus,</hi> pag. 8. and line 8. <hi>He that hath the ſame ſpirit that rayſed up Ieſus Chriſt, is equall with God.</hi> And againe thus, line 11. &amp;c, <hi>As Ieſus Chriſt which is the myſtery, hath paſſed before, ſo the ſame ſpirit takes upon it the ſame ſeed, and is the ſame where it is made manifeſt.</hi> Where it is clearely his deſigne to ſhew, that there is the ſame <hi>hypoſtaticall union</hi> betwixt the ſpirit and our nature, where the ſpirit dwels, as was betwixt the Divine nature, and the Humane in the Lord Jeſus.</p>

For having told him, he was damned; yet he alſo tells him, that he crucifieth Chriſt within him, &amp;c. What is this, but to affirme Chriſt under corruption?

                     </label> For the firſt, that Chriſt is the <hi>true light,</hi> is confeſſed on all hands; but that Ieſus Chriſt is in every man, or gives a ſaving light to every man, we utterly deny: and we have plentifully proved in our anſwer to the fourth Poſition. The firſt Text he proves it by, is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. <hi>He is the true light that lightneth every one.</hi> We have fully opened this Text in our anſwer to the fourth Poſition, and convincingly ſhewed, it is not meant at all of any Goſpel ſaving light, where we deſire the Reader to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himſelfe at large.<note place="margin">Io. 8.12. <hi>opened.</hi>

Secondly, the words immediately following, might ſatisfie <hi>Nayler,</hi> that he is thus a ſaving light onely to them that follow him, who are Beleevers, drawne by the power of the ſpirit of God. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>No man comes to me except the Father draw me.</hi> Iohn 6.44.45. <hi>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father commeth to me:</hi> So that Chriſt is onely the light of thoſe that have learned of the Father, and have been drawne by the Father, and follow him.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44723:33"/> could not apprehend him, when he was Preached openly to them. His fourth Text is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. <hi>this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,</hi> is as full againſt <hi>Nayler,</hi> as the former: for it ſpeaks this, that Jeſus Chriſt is the true light, was Preached to the World and diſcovered to them, when he had before been a miſtery, hid from Ages and Generations, <hi>Col.</hi> 1, 28. yet they would not beleeve him, but loved to continue in that darkeneſſe, or ignorance of Chriſt, which is in all by nature.</p>

We have abundantly proved, that Jeſus Chriſt is not in all, in out anſwer to his reply to the fourth Poſition. 2. We have alſo proved, That Ieſus Chriſt neither is in all, nor doth he enlighten all, by giving every man a knowledge of the Goſpel; this we have done at large in the ſame place. 3. We have fully proved, that all men in the world doe need an outward light or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and that it is the way of Chriſt his making knowne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by outward diſcovery, and Preaching the Goſpel, in the <hi>Perfect Phariſee,</hi> pag. 18.19, in ſix arguments, to which <hi>Nayler</hi> anſwer nothing.<note place="margin">Neceſſity of outward reaching, further proved.</note> All that he brings for it <hi>de novo,</hi> in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, is onely his bare word, without either argument or text; ſo that we need to ſay no more.
